💫 About Me:
Hi! 👋 I'm a passionate AWS DevOps Engineer with 4 years of experience in building, managing, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. My expertise lies in leveraging the power of AWS cloud technologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools to streamline development workflows and deliver scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient solutions.

Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with tools like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, helping teams automate processes and reduce deployment time through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I specialize in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to create repeatable, versioned infrastructure deployments, ensuring consistency and security at scale.
